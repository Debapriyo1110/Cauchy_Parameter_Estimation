This project focuses on estimating the scale parameter of the Cauchy distribution using robust techniques based on fractional absolute moments. The code implements a family of scale estimators using fractional powers of absolute deviations from the sample median, including the special case where the estimator becomes the geometric mean. These estimators are compared with classical methods like the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and the Interquartile-based estimator (QD). A simulation study is carried out with 1000 samples of size 30, drawn from a Cauchy distribution with location 5 and scale 2. For each estimator, the bias and mean squared error (MSE) are computed and visualised to identify optimal tuning parameters. The project is implemented in R using the psych and cauchypca libraries.
